"""The live state block -- what replaces the node graph.

A node graph makes the state machine GENERATE the reply, which is backwards:
when the caller says something no edge matches, there is no transition and the
agent goes silent. That is the Dograh bug, and it is structural.

Here the state machine only CONSTRAINS. The model always generates, so there is
never an edge to fall off. This block is ~80 tokens injected fresh each turn --
it tells the agent where it is and what it still owes, without ever blocking it
from answering whatever was actually said.
